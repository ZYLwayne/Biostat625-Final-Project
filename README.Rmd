# Hospital Length of Stay Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the key factors influencing Length of Stay (LOS) for hospitalized patients and predict LOS using machine learning models. The models compared include:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
3.  Random Forest

Through data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, the results demonstrate that the Random Forest model achieves the best prediction accuracy with the lowest RMSE.

## Data Description

-   **Source File**: `INFO02v4.csv`

-   The dataset contains patient admission records, costs, demographics, and hospital service area information.

### Key Features:

-   **Type.of.Admission**: Admission type

-   **Length.of.Stay**: Hospital stay duration (target variable)

-   **Total.Costs** and **Total.Charges**: Costs associated with the stay

-   **Age.Group**: Age groups of patients

-   **Hospital.Service.Area**: Hospital service regions

-   **Race** and **Ethnicity**: Patient demographic information

### Methods and Tools

### Analysis Workflow:

1.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

    -   Removal of missing values and redundant variables.

    -   Feature transformation (logarithmic scaling and encoding categorical variables).

2.  Feature Engineering

    -   One-hot encoding for categorical features.

    -   Log transformation for continuous variables.

3.  Model Training and Evaluation

    -   Linear Regression: A baseline model for comparison.

    -   CART: A decision tree-based model to handle nonlinearity.

    -   Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for high predictive accuracy.

4.  Model Performance Metrics

    -   RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\*\* to evaluate model accuracy.

    -   Cross-validation to ensure model stability and generalizability.

5.  Visualization

    -   Boxplots, RMSE comparison tables, and variable importance plots.

### Tools and Libraries:

-   Programming Language: R

-   Key Libraries:

    -   `ggplot2`: Visualization

    -   `caret`: Model training and evaluation

    -   `randomForest`: Random Forest model

    -   `rpart`: CART model

    -   `dplyr`, `tidyverse`: Data manipulation

## Results

### Model Performance (RMSE)

The performance of the models is summarized as follows:

| **Model** | **RMSE (No Cross-Validation)** | **RMSE (With Cross-Validation)** |
|----|----|----|
| **Linear Regression** | 13.05 | 0.4074 |
| **CART** | 9.64 | 0.5998 |
| **Random Forest** | **8.83** | **0.3968** |

**Conclusion**:\
The **Random Forest model** outperformed the other two models, achieving the lowest RMSE. This demonstrates its ability to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables.
